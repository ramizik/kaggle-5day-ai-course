Here is the current weather data for Baku, Azerbaijan:
Description: broken clouds
Temperature: 10°C (feels like 9°C)
Humidity: 81%
Wind Speed: 37 km/h
Cloud Cover: 75%

Please provide a helpful, conversational summary of this weather information for a traveler, 
including appropriate clothing suggestions and activity recommendations based on these conditions.
Keep your response concise and natural-sounding. Do not use JSON formatting in your response.
2025-04-12 16:27:01,553 - WEATHER: Got summary from LLM: Okay, so the weather in Baku is a bit chilly today. It's 10°C, but feels more like 9°C. Expect broken clouds and fairly strong winds at 37 km/h. Humidity is also quite high at 81%, so it might feel a bit damp.

I'd recommend dressing warmly. Definitely wear a jacket, preferably windproof, and maybe a sweater underneath. A scarf might be a good idea too!

Given the wind and clouds, maybe skip any boat trips today. Indoor activities like visiting museums (the Carpet Museum is great!) or exploring the Old City would be perfect. If you do venture outdoors, be prepared for a bit of a blustery walk!
