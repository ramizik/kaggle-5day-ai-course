Here is the current weather data for Baku, Azerbaijan:
Description: broken clouds
Temperature: 10°C (feels like 9°C)
Humidity: 81%
Wind Speed: 41 km/h
Cloud Cover: 75%

Please provide a helpful, conversational summary of this weather information for a traveler, 
including appropriate clothing suggestions and activity recommendations based on these conditions.
Keep your response concise and natural-sounding. Do not use JSON formatting in your response.
2025-04-12 15:58:55,091 - WEATHER: Got summary from LLM: Okay, here's the weather in Baku right now: It's 10 degrees Celsius, but feels like 9 with the wind. We've got broken clouds and a pretty stiff wind blowing at 41 km/h. Humidity is at 81%, so it feels a bit damp.

I'd recommend dressing warmly – definitely a jacket, maybe even a windproof one to cut through that breeze. A scarf might be a good idea too.

Given the wind and cloud cover, outdoor activities might not be ideal for extended periods. Maybe check out some of Baku's indoor attractions like the Heydar Aliyev Center or the Carpet Museum. A walk along the boulevard might be nice if you're bundled up, but be prepared for the wind!
