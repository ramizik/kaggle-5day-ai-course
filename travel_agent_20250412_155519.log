Here is the current weather data for Baku, Azerbaijan:
Description: broken clouds
Temperature: 10°C (feels like 9°C)
Humidity: 81%
Wind Speed: 41 km/h
Cloud Cover: 75%

Please provide a helpful, conversational summary of this weather information for a traveler, 
including appropriate clothing suggestions and activity recommendations based on these conditions.
Keep your response concise and natural-sounding. Do not use JSON formatting in your response.
2025-04-12 15:55:28,705 - WEATHER: Got summary from LLM: Okay, here's the weather in Baku: It's 10 degrees Celsius, but it feels more like 9, so a bit chilly! We've got broken clouds and the humidity is fairly high at 81%. It's also quite windy, with winds at 41 km/h.

I'd definitely recommend wearing layers, including a jacket or coat to protect from the wind. Maybe a scarf too! Given the cloud cover, you might not get much sun, but it's still worth bringing sunglasses just in case.

As for activities, maybe indoor museums or a cozy cafe would be nice to escape the wind. If you do venture outdoors, stick to sheltered areas. A walk along the boulevard might be a bit blustery, but still doable if you're bundled up!
