Here is the current weather data for Baku, Azerbaijan:
Description: broken clouds
Temperature: 10°C (feels like 9°C)
Humidity: 81%
Wind Speed: 37 km/h
Cloud Cover: 75%

Please provide a helpful, conversational summary of this weather information for a traveler, 
including appropriate clothing suggestions and activity recommendations based on these conditions.
Keep your response concise and natural-sounding. Do not use JSON formatting in your response.
2025-04-12 16:09:54,322 - WEATHER: Got summary from LLM: Okay, here's the weather in Baku: It's 10 degrees Celsius, but feels like 9 with the wind chill. Expect broken clouds, high humidity at 81%, and pretty strong winds at 37 km/h. Cloud cover is at 75%, so it's mostly cloudy.

I'd recommend dressing warmly in layers. A jacket or coat is a must, and maybe a sweater or fleece underneath. Consider bringing a scarf to protect from the wind.

As for activities, maybe indoor museums or exploring the Old City would be good choices today. With the wind, outdoor activities might be a bit uncomfortable, but if you're bundled up, a walk along the Caspian Sea could still be enjoyable!
