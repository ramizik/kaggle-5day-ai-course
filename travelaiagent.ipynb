It's part of Gemini's **system instruction** capability — a powerful way to steer tone, style, and behavior of the model. Here, we tell the assistant to act like a friendly, well-traveled guide who gives practical, friendly advice with just the right amount of emojis. It also encourages the bot to remember preferences the user shares and to speak like a helpful person — not a robot.\n\nThis instruction is passed into the Gemini API's config to control every future response the assistant generates.\n\n---\n\n### `onboarding_message` 👋\n\nThis is the first message the user sees when launching the chatbot — kind of like the assistant's welcome pitch. It sets expectations for what the assistant can help with: weather, tips, events, image translation, itinerary planning, and more. The list-style format, combined with emojis, keeps it light and easy to read. This message is printed to the user and stored in the chat history as the assistant's first message.\n\n---\n\n### ⚙️ Connecting to Gemini using genai.Client","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"TRAVELAGENT_SYSINT = (\n    \"You are TravelAIAgent, a helpful and friendly AI travel companion.

To handle this, we use a technique called function routing, powered by Gemini.\n\nThe interpret_user_request() function acts as the brain of this routing system. It sends the user's message to Gemini with a carefully crafted prompt that explains how to classify the input. The prompt includes examples of how to convert natural language into a structured Python dictionary, such as: {'intent': 'get_weather', 'location': 'Paris'} or {'intent': 'plan_itinerary', 'location': 'Rome', 'days': 3, 'when': 'next week'} or {'intent': 'get_tip', 'query': 'public transport in Tokyo'}\n\nGemini then replies with a dictionary string, and we use Python’s ast.literal_eval() to safely convert that string into a real Python dictionary. This dictionary tells the assistant which intent to handle, and which handler function to trigger.\nIf something goes wrong — such as Gemini returning an invalid dictionary — we default to a generic 'chat' intent, so the assistant can still respond gracefully.\n\n---\n\n## 🏙️ Extracting City Names\nSometimes users don’t explicitly state a city in a clean format, especially when asking for travel tips or events. To improve contextual understanding, we use the extract_city_from_text() function. This is a lightweight utility that asks Gemini to pull a city name from any given sentence.\n\nFor example:\n“Tell me more about Zurich” → returns \"Zurich\", “What can I do there?” → returns \"None\"\n\nIt helps ensure the assistant tracks which city is being discussed, so it can recall that later (e.g. when asked \"What's the weather like there?\"). This adds a subtle layer of memory and personalization to the interaction, without requiring complex NER models or external parsers.","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# BETA\n# Show response\nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown, Image\n\ndef show_response(response, label=\"🤖 TravelAIAgent said\"):\n    # Show label as Markdown header\n    if label:\n        display(Markdown(f\"**{label}:**\"))\n\n    for p in response.parts:\n        if p.text:\n            display(Markdown(p.text))\n        elif p.inline_data:\n            display(Image(p.inline_data.data))\n        else:\n            print(p.to_json_dict())\n\n    display(Markdown('----'))\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-17T23:16:24.650232Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-17T23:16:24.650510Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-17T23:16:24.657009Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-17T23:16:24.650480Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-17T23:16:24.655763Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":6},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import ast\n\ndef interpret_user_request(user_input):\n    prompt = (\n        \"You are a function router.

Instead of just dumping raw data, it prepares a natural-language summary with the help of Gemini. The API response is parsed to extract key weather details like: Current temperature, Feels-like temperature, Humidity, Wind speed, General weather description. Then, a prompt is crafted to instruct Gemini to summarize this like a local travel agent would — conversational, helpful, and using emojis where appropriate.\\\nFor example:\n“It’s around 15°C in Lisbon right now with a nice breeze and clear skies — perfect for walking the old town! 🌤️👟”\nThis makes the response feel more human and trip-relevant, not just like reading numbers.\n\n**get_weather_summary(city) – 5-Day Forecast**\\\nInstead of a snapshot, this function gathers a multi-day forecast from OpenWeather, broken into 3-hour segments across five days. The forecast entries are grouped by date, and then passed to Gemini in a structured format. The LLM is asked to: Summarize the general vibe of each day, highlight rain or great outdoor weather, and recommend the best days for activities. This is especially useful when building itineraries, since it helps the assistant match sunny days with walking tours or outdoor activities, and reserve indoor options for rainy ones.\\\nFor example:\n“Tuesday looks rainy 🌧️ — maybe plan some museum time.

The result is a travel assistant that can read and interpret photos like a human guide would.\\\n**User can upload photos (.png) to Kaggle dataseet named \"photos\" and attach it to this notebook. This will allow Travel Agent to interact with photos. To reference the photo in chat, user needs to use followig format \"imgName.png\". For example: Translate the text from the picture RoseGarden.png**\n\n**extract_text_from_image(file_path) – OCR with Gemini Vision** 📷🔤\\\nThis function allows users to upload an image (like a street sign, museum label, or food menu), and have the assistant extract all visible text from it. It uses Gemini 1.5 Pro’s multimodal vision model, which is capable of reading embedded text from real-world photos.\\\nThe function opens the image file in binary mode, attaches it to a prompt asking Gemini to extract all visible text (but not translate), and then returns the raw string. This step is useful when the goal is to understand what’s written in a local language before translating or explaining it.\n\n**translate_to_english(text) – Text Translation** 🌐🗣️\\\nOnce the text is extracted from an image, we pass it to this function, which uses Gemini 2.0 Flash to translate it into English. The prompt is simple and direct: translate the following text.\\\nThis lets users take photos of signs, menus, schedules, or maps and instantly understand what they mean — perfect for tourists navigating unfamiliar environments.\\\nFor example: A French street sign like \"Rue des Bourneaux\" → \"Bourneaux Street\"\n\n**describe_photo(file_path) – Landmark and Scene Description** 🏛️✨\\\nThis function goes beyond OCR and answers a higher-level question: “What am I looking at?”\\\nIt uses Gemini 1.5 Pro to analyze the image and describe the scene, including its possible cultural or historical context. It’s especially useful for travel photos like landmarks, public art, or architecture. The prompt instructs Gemini to describe what’s in the image and why it might matter to a traveler — similar to how a museum guide or tour book would explain a location.\\\nFor example: Upload a photo of the Eiffel Tower → “This is the Eiffel Tower in Paris, an iconic symbol of France built for the 1889 World's Fair…”","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Extract text from image\ndef extract_text_from_image(file_path: str) -> str:\n    with open(file_path, \"rb\") as img:\n        image_bytes = img.read()\n\n    prompt = \"Extract all visible text from this image.

It returns a list of upcoming events sorted by date — concerts, sports, exhibitions, shows, and more. We limit the number of results using max_events (default is 5) to avoid overwhelming the user and focus on the most relevant options. For each event, we extract key info such as name, date, venue\\\nInstead of listing raw data directly to the user, the assistant passes the list to Gemini 2.0 Flash using a well-crafted prompt. Gemini then summarizes the events in a casual, friendly tone — just like a travel agent would.\\\nFor example: “This week in San Francisco: balloon art exhibits, jazz at Birdland, and some Broadway action if you’re feeling theatrical. 🎷🎭”\\\nThe prompt also nudges Gemini to recommend which events suit different travelers (families, art lovers, music fans), highlight variety and uniqueness, and keep the tone fun and helpful","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def get_events(city: str, start_date: str = None, end_date: str = None, max_events: int = 5) -> str:\n    url = \"https://app.ticketmaster.com/discovery/v2/events.json\"\n\n    params = {\n        \"apikey\": EVENTS_API_KEY,\n        \"city\": city,\n        \"sort\": \"date,asc\",\n        \"locale\": \"*\",\n    }\n\n    if start_date:\n        params[\"startDateTime\"] = start_date\n    if end_date:\n        params[\"endDateTime\"] = end_date\n\n    response = requests.get(url, params=params)\n    if response.status_code != 200:\n        return f\"Sorry, I couldn't fetch events for {city}.\"\n\n    data = response.json()\n    events = data.get(\"_embedded\", {}).get(\"events\", [])[:max_events]\n\n    if not events:\n        return f\"No upcoming events found in {city}.\"\n\n    # Prepare input for Gemini\n    raw_event_lines = []\n    for event in events:\n        name = event.get(\"name\", \"Unnamed Event\")\n        date = event.get(\"dates\", {}).get(\"start\", {}).get(\"localDate\", \"Unknown Date\")\n        venue = event.get(\"_embedded\", {}).get(\"venues\", [{}])[0].get(\"name\", \"Unknown Venue\")\n        line = f\"{name} on {date} at {venue}\"\n        raw_event_lines.append(line)\n\n    event_input = \"\\n\".join(raw_event_lines)\n\n    # Gemini prompt\n    prompt = (\n    f\"You are a helpful travel assistant creating a quick event guide for someone visiting {city}. \"\n    f\"Use a relaxed, natural tone — no greetings like 'Hey there' or introductions. \"\n    f\"Highlight 3–5 events that are good for travelers, based on their variety (music, sports, art, comedy, etc.). \"\n    f\"For each one, mention why it's interesting or who might enjoy it (e.g., for music lovers, for families, for night owls, etc.). \"\n    f\"Write like a local giving tips to a friend.

This section combines ChromaDB (a vector database), Gemini embeddings, and Gemini's language generation to bring real-world knowledge into the assistant's responses.\n\n**🧳 documents – Curated Travel Tips**\\\nWe start with a hardcoded list of helpful, city-specific cultural tips and travel advice. These act as a lightweight knowledge base. Each item is a short, practical sentence — perfect for answering questions like: “What should I know before going to Tokyo?”, “Is it okay to haggle in Marrakech?”\n\n**🧠 GeminiEmbeddingFunction – Semantic Understanding**\\\nTo search through these tips in a meaningful way, we embed both the tips and the user's queries using Gemini's text-embedding-004 model. This converts text into high-dimensional vectors that capture their semantic meaning. The class supports two modes: \"retrieval_document\" – for indexing passages and \"retrieval_query\" – for embedding the user's question. This ensures the model can retrieve relevant advice even if the user asks in a different phrasing than what’s stored.\n\n**🗃️ chroma_client + chromaDB – Embedding Storage**\\\nWe initialize a ChromaDB collection named \"travel_tips\", embed the list of tips, and store them by unique IDs. This allows the assistant to quickly search for tips that are most relevant to the user's question at runtime.\n\n**❓ search_and_answer(user_question) – RAG Answering**\\\nWhen a user asks for tips or cultural context: The function switches to query mode -> Finds the top 2 semantically similar tips from ChromaDB -> Passes those into Gemini 2.0 Flash using a prompt that instructs it to generate a helpful, grounded answer. This pattern ensures that answers are both relevant and informed by the actual data — a key aspect of building trust in AI assistants. In case of missing suggestion for particular city, the function asks LLM to provide user with tips.\n\n**🖼️ Image Insights: photo_collection + search_photo_insights()**\\\nWe use the same RAG pipeline to store and query descriptions of user-uploaded photos (e.g. landmarks, statues, monuments). After describing a photo using Gemini Vision, the description is embedded and added to a separate collection (photo_insights). Then, if the user asks: “What is that building?” or “What’s the story behind this statue?”. We use search_photo_insights() to pull relevant image descriptions from the vector DB and let Gemini answer based on that context.\n\nTogether, these components turn your assistant into a context-aware, grounded travel expert.

Executes a specific capability (like getting weather or generating an itinerary)\n2. Updates the assistant’s memory if needed (e.g. storing the last mentioned city)\n3. Prints and stores the response in the conversation history\n\n---\n\n**🌤️ handle_get_weather & handle_get_weather_forecast**\\\nThese handlers fetch current conditions or a 5-day forecast from OpenWeather and summarize it using Gemini. They store the city as memory[\"last_city\"] so the assistant can reference it later when the user says, “What’s the weather like there?”\n\n**🧳 handle_get_tip**\\\nThis pulls grounded cultural advice from ChromaDB using a RAG-style query. It also extracts and stores the city mentioned in the user’s tip-related question to maintain context.\n\n**📸 handle_describe_photo, handle_ask_about_photo, handle_image_translate**\\\nThese three handlers handle photo-related requests:\n1. describe_photo: Uses Gemini Vision to describe what’s in an uploaded image (e.g. a statue or landmark)\n2. ask_about_photo: Allows follow-up questions using photo-based RAG from ChromaDB\n3. image_translate: Extracts and translates visible text from a photo (e.g. street signs or menus)\nThey help users understand and interact with their surroundings more easily, especially in unfamiliar places.\n\n**🌆 handle_get_events**\\\nThis fetches events in a city using the Ticketmaster Discovery API and summarizes them using Gemini. The results feel natural and tailored — great for finding things to do on the fly.\n\n**🧠 handle_get_weather_last & handle_get_last_city**\\\nThese support context-awareness. If the user asks: “What’s the weather like there?” or “Which city was I talking about?”. The assistant responds intelligently based on the memory dictionary (memory[\"last_city\"]), maintaining a natural and coherent conversation flow.\n\n**🗺️ handle_plan_itinerary**\n\nThis is one of the most impressive handlers — it builds a personalized, multi-day itinerary by combining:\n\n1. 🌦️ Real-time multi-day **weather forecasts**\n2. 🧳 Cultural **travel tips** retrieved using **ChromaDB + Gemini embeddings**\n3. 💬 **User preferences** (gathered naturally during conversation and stored in memory)\n4. 🎟️ Local **event listings** using the Ticketmaster Discovery API\n\nThe handler intelligently estimates the trip start date based on natural language like \"next week\" or \"this weekend\", and then assembles all relevant information into a prompt that Gemini uses to generate a highly tailored itinerary.\n\n---\n\n🧠 **LLM-Based Self-Evaluation**: After the itinerary is generated, TravelAIAgent passes it back to Gemini for **self-assessment**. The model scores the itinerary on:\n- Balance between indoor/outdoor activities\n- Cultural authenticity\n- Weather suitability\n- Personalization based on your preferences\n\nGemini then responds with a 🌍 **Travel Score out of 10**, plus helpful feedback. This makes it easy for users to assess the quality of the plan, catch gaps, and get suggestions — making the experience more trustworthy and intelligent.\n\n✨ **Export Features**: After generating the itinerary, the user is automatically asked whether they'd like to export it. If yes, the plan and evaluation can be saved in:\n- 📄 **Markdown format (.md)**\n- 📄 **PDF format** (beautifully rendered with basic formatting)\n- The bot also supports a `!export` command at any time during the session to export the entire **chat history** (including both user inputs and AI responses) into a `.md` file. This makes it easy to revisit recommendations, itinerary details, or planning discussions.\n- When exporting the itinerary to a file, user **must** include the format of a file in a filename i.e **travelItinerary.md** or **travelItinerary.pdf**\n","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Handlers\ndef handle_get_weather(action, history, memory):\n    city = action[\"location\"]\n    memory[\"last_city\"] = city\n    weather_info = get_weather(city)\n    show_response(types.ModelContent(parts=[types.Part.from_text(text=weather_info)]))\n    history.append(types.ModelContent(parts=[types.Part.from_text(text=weather_info)]))\n\ndef handle_get_tip(action, history, memory):\n    query = action[\"query\"]\n    city = extract_city_from_text(query)\n    memory[\"last_city\"] = city if city else query\n    tip_answer = search_and_answer(query)\n    show_response(types.ModelContent(parts=[types.Part.from_text(text=tip_answer)]))\n    history.append(types.ModelContent(parts=[types.Part.from_text(text=tip_answer)]))\n\ndef handle_describe_photo(action, history):\n    filename = action[\"filename\"]\n    filepath = f\"/kaggle/input/photos/{filename}\"\n\n    try:\n        with open(filepath, \"rb\") as f:\n            f.read(1)\n        if filename not in photo_collection.get()['ids']:\n            description = describe_photo(filepath)\n            add_photo_description_to_chromadb(photo_id=filename, description=description)\n            show_response(types.ModelContent(parts=[types.Part.from_text(text=description)]))\n            history.append(types.ModelContent(parts=[types.Part.from_text(text=description)]))\n        else:\n            print(f\"🤖 TravelAIAgent: I already have a description for `{filename}`.\")\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"🤖 TravelAIAgent: I couldn't find the image `{filename}` in /kaggle/input/photos/.\")\n\ndef handle_ask_about_photo(user_input, history):\n    if not photo_collection.get()['documents']:\n        print(\"🤖 TravelAIAgent: I haven’t analyzed any photos yet.

It’s where everything comes together — intent recognition, memory tracking, handler dispatching, and fallback chat. Here's how it works:\n\n---\n\n**🕘 history and memory Initialization**\\\nThe assistant starts with two critical variables:\n1. history: a list that stores the full back-and-forth conversation (in Gemini’s expected format). It keeps context across turns.\n2. memory: a dictionary that stores session-specific context like: last_city: the most recently mentioned city (used for follow-ups like \"What's the weather like there?\"), and  preferences: any user-specified likes (e.g. “I love seafood”) that guide future responses\n\n---\n**👋 First Impression: Onboarding Message**\\\nThe assistant prints a warm welcome using the onboarding_message and also adds it to the conversation history. This sets the tone and immediately informs the user of the assistant’s capabilities.\n\n---\n\n**🔁 The Main Loop**\\\nThis is a while True: loop that simulates ongoing conversation. Each time the user enters input: User message is read and cleaned, and intent is interpreted using interpret_user_request()\n\nThe assistant routes the request to the appropriate handler: Weather, Cultural tips, Photo analysis, Event search, Itinerary planning, Translation, Memory recall, Handlers take care of fetching data, calling APIs, or prompting Gemini, then store the result back in history.\n\n---\n\n**🧠 Fallback Branch**\\\nIf none of the intent matches are triggered (e.g. the user says something casual or vague): The input is added to history, Gemini is called with full context to continue the conversation naturally. Optionally, if the user shares a preference (e.g. \"I love museums\"), it’s stored in memory[\"preferences\"] for future personalization. A try/except block ensures any Gemini API failures are handled gracefully without breaking the loop — offering a friendly error instead of a crash.","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def start_travel_chat():\n    history = []\n    memory = {\n        \"last_city\": None,\n        \"preferences\": []\n    }\n    onboarding_block = types.ModelContent(parts=[types.Part.from_text(text=onboarding_message)])\n    history.append(onboarding_block)\n    show_response(onboarding_block)\n    \n    # Main loop\n    while True:\n        user_input = input(\"👤 You:\").strip()\n        \n        # Menu options\n        # Quit - Use !q, !quit or quit to end the conversation.\n        if user_input.strip().lower() in ['!q', 'quit', '!quit']:\n            print(\"Thanks for using TravelAIAgent.

April 21st will also have a good amount of sun, so it is also a good day for exploring."},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"----"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdin","text":"👤 You: Create a travel itinerary to San Francisco for 3 days next week.\n"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"**🤖 TravelAIAgent said:**"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"Alright, cookie-loving beach bum, let's craft an amazing 3-day San Francisco itinerary for you, keeping that sweet tooth and beach yearning in mind! We're going to capitalize on those sunny days while having backup plans in case Karl the Fog (San Francisco's infamous fog) decides to visit.\n\n**Important Note:** You're arriving *next week*, which means your trip starts around **April 22nd, 2025**. I'll plan assuming your 3 days are April 22nd, 23rd, and 24th. Remember to book Alcatraz tickets *immediately* if you want to go! They sell out weeks in advance.\n\n**Day 1: Golden Gate Views, Coastal Delights, and Cookie Dreams (April 22nd - Sunshine Today!)**\n\n*   **Morning (9:00 AM):** Let's kick things off with a classic! Head to **Crissy Field**. This former airfield offers stunning, unobstructed views of the Golden Gate Bridge. Stroll along the waterfront, breathe in the fresh air, and snap some iconic photos. There's also a great little cafe there called **\"Crissy Field Warming Hut\"** for a quick coffee or snack.\n*   **Mid-Morning (11:00 AM):** Rent a bike (many rental places are near Crissy Field) and **cycle across the Golden Gate Bridge!** It's an unforgettable experience. You can bike all the way to Sausalito, a charming waterfront town, and take the ferry back to San Francisco.  Alternatively, if you're not a cyclist, you can walk part of the way or take a bus across.\n*   **Lunch (1:00 PM):** In Sausalito (if you biked), grab some delicious seafood at **Scoma's** or **The Spinnaker** for incredible views of the city skyline. If you stayed in San Francisco, check out the delicious eateries in the **Marina District**.\n*   **Afternoon (3:00 PM):** **Beach Time!** Head to **Baker Beach**. This beach offers beautiful views of the Golden Gate Bridge. Pack a blanket, soak up the sun (if it's out!), and enjoy the scenery. Note: The northern end of Baker Beach is clothing-optional. If that's not your vibe, stick to the southern end.\n*   **Evening (6:00 PM):** Time for a **cookie adventure!** Head to **\"B Patisserie\"** in Pacific Heights. Their Kouign Amann is legendary. While not strictly cookies, it's a pastry-lovers dream. Grab a coffee, enjoy your treat, and soak in the neighborhood vibes.\n*   **Dinner (7:30 PM):** Explore the trendy neighborhood of **North Beach** for dinner. This historic Italian district is packed with great restaurants. For a classic San Francisco experience, grab a pizza at **Tony's Pizza Napoletana** (be prepared for a wait!) or enjoy some authentic Italian at **Sotto Mare**.\n*   **Night (9:00 PM):** If you're up for it, catch some live jazz at the historic **Grant & Green** in North Beach.\n\n**Day 2: Culture, Quirks, and Waterfront Wonders (April 23rd)**\n\n*   **Morning (9:00 AM):** Immerse yourself in the unique experience of **Balloon Museum | Emotion Air - Art you can feel at the Palace of Fine Arts**. The Palace of Fine Arts is an architectural marvel worth visiting in itself.  Plus, a \"balloon\" exhibit sounds like a ton of fun.\n*   **Late Morning (11:30 AM):** Explore the **Presidio National Park.** This former military base has been transformed into a beautiful park with walking trails, art installations (like Andy Goldsworthy's \"Wood Line\"), and stunning views.\n*   **Lunch (1:00 PM):** Head to **Fisherman's Wharf** for a classic (albeit touristy) San Francisco experience. Grab some clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl – a must-try! **Boudin Bakery** is the most famous for this.\n*   **Afternoon (2:30 PM):** Visit **Pier 39** to see the famous **sea lions!** They're loud, smelly, and totally entertaining.\n*   **Late Afternoon (4:00 PM):** Check out the **Exploratorium** (if you're into science and interactive exhibits) or take a **Bay Cruise** for a different perspective of the city skyline and the Golden Gate Bridge. (Consider buying a Go San Francisco card for discounts on attractions like this).\n*   **Evening (6:00 PM):** Explore **Chinatown**, the oldest Chinatown in North America! Wander through the bustling streets, admire the architecture, and soak in the atmosphere.\n*   **Dinner (7:30 PM):** Enjoy a delicious and authentic Chinese dinner in Chinatown. **Z & Y Restaurant** is a popular choice.\n*   **Night (9:00 PM):** Enjoy a post-dinner dessert in Chinatown. Maybe some yummy milk tea.\n\n**Day 3: Hills, History, and Hidden Gems (April 24th)**\n\n*   **Morning (9:00 AM):** Start your day with a ride on a **cable car!** Take the Powell-Hyde line for the most scenic route, passing by Lombard Street (\"the most crooked street in the world\").\n*   **Mid-Morning (10:30 AM):** Explore **Lombard Street** itself, snapping some fun photos.\n*   **Late Morning (11:30 AM):** Head to **Alcatraz Island** (assuming you booked your tickets!). The ferry ride offers great views of the city. The audio tour of the former prison is fascinating. Allow at least 2.5-3 hours for the entire Alcatraz experience.\n*   **Lunch (1:30 PM):** After returning from Alcatraz, grab a quick and tasty lunch near Fisherman's Wharf. Maybe some fish and chips or a sandwich.\n*   **Afternoon (3:00 PM):** Visit **Ghirardelli Square**. Sure, it's touristy, but it's hard to resist the temptation of Ghirardelli chocolate! Indulge in a sundae and enjoy the waterfront views.\n*   **Late Afternoon (4:30 PM):** Explore the **Haight-Ashbury**, the birthplace of the hippie movement. Browse the vintage shops, check out the colorful murals, and soak in the counterculture vibe.\n*   **Evening (6:00 PM):** Head to **Golden Gate Park**. Enjoy a leisurely stroll.\n*   **Dinner (7:30 PM):** For a final San Francisco meal, consider **Foreign Cinema** in the Mission District. It's known for its Mediterranean-inspired cuisine and the films projected onto the courtyard wall.\n*   **Night (9:30 PM):** Get one last cookie (or pastry) at Tartine Bakery to end your day of fun and exploration.\n\n**Important Considerations & Local Tips:**\n\n*   **Transportation:** Purchase a Muni Passport for unlimited rides on buses, streetcars, and cable cars. BART is separate and requires a separate ticket. Consider using ride-sharing services like Uber or Lyft for longer distances.\n*   **Comfortable Shoes:** You'll be doing a lot of walking!\n*   **Reservations:** Make reservations for popular restaurants, especially for dinner.\n*   **Golden Gate Bridge Closure:** Check if the bridge is open to pedestrians and cyclists on the day you plan to visit.\n*   **\"Karl the Fog\" Backup Plan:** If the weather turns foggy, consider visiting museums like the de Young Museum or the California Academy of Sciences in Golden Gate Park.\n*   **Don't be afraid to explore:** San Francisco is a city full of hidden gems. Wander off the beaten path and discover something new!\n\nHave an amazing trip to San Francisco! Enjoy the cookies, the beaches, and all the city has to offer! Let me know if you have any other questions."},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"----"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"**🤖 TravelAIAgent said:**"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"Hey there! I wanted to let you know that I took a look back at the itinerary I created for your San Francisco trip, just to make sure it's as awesome as it can be. My goal here is to give you a little extra confidence in the plan and maybe even spark some ideas for tweaks to make it absolutely perfect for you.\n\nHere's my assessment:\n\n🌍 Travel Score: 8/10\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Personalization:** The itinerary definitely takes your love for cookies and beaches into account! Baker Beach and multiple cookie/pastry suggestions were incorporated.\n*   **Balance:** A good mix of outdoor activities (bridge, beaches, parks) and indoor options (museums, shops) is considered.\n*   **Weather Considerations:** The plan suggests alternative indoor activities (\"Karl the Fog\" backup plan)\n*   **Local Experiences:** Includes iconic San Francisco experiences like riding cable cars, Fisherman's Wharf, and exploring diverse neighborhoods like Chinatown and North Beach.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Cookie Focus:** While cookies were mentioned, the itinerary could sprinkle in a few more specific cookie shop recommendations (besides B. Patisserie and Tartine) or a dedicated cookie tasting experience, maybe even a small detour.\n*   **Beach Variety:** The itinerary only includes Baker Beach. Adding an alternate beach with different scenery or activities (e.g., Ocean Beach for surfing or Fort Funston for dog-friendly fun) could enhance the beach experience, if that's something you like!\n*   **Alcatraz Timing:** Alcatraz might take longer than anticipated, potentially causing a rushed lunch. Consider shifting lunch slightly earlier or providing a flexible lunch option near the pier.\n\nOverall, I think it's a pretty solid plan that caters to your preferences and showcases the best of San Francisco!"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"----"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdin","text":"\n📝 Export this itinerary?
