Welcome to my submission for the 5-day **Google x Kaggle Generative AI Capstone Project!**\n\n## **TravelAIAgent: A Multimodal Conversational Travel Planner**\n\nIn this project, we build **TravelAIAgent**, a multimodal conversational assistant that helps users plan and enjoy their trips using natural language, photos, and real-time data. It combines intelligent itinerary building, contextual cultural advice, event lookup, photo translation, and user preferences — all in a notebook-friendly chatbot you can interact with directly. Just scroll to the bottom to try it out!\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nTravelers often bounce between weather apps, ticketing sites, translation tools, and tourist blogs — especially when on the go.\n\n**TravelAIAgent simplifies this by acting like a smart, friendly AI travel companion** who:\n- Understands both **natural language** and **tourist photos**\n- Offers **personalized suggestions** based on your preferences\n- Uses **real-time APIs** for weather and events\n- Generates **multi-day travel itineraries**\n- Evaluates its own recommendations with an LLM “meta-check”\n- Summarizes and translates **text in images**\n- Stores helpful memory like your favorite activities or last city\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How It Works: Architecture & Core Design\n\nThe assistant is built around an **intent-based routing system** that detects what kind of request you're making, and sends it to a specific handler.\n\n### 🔧 Key Components:\n- **Gemini 2.0 Flash + Gemini 1.5 Pro Vision** for all language and image understanding\n- **OpenWeather API** for live and forecasted weather data\n- **Ticketmaster Discovery API** for city events and experiences\n- **ChromaDB + `text-embedding-004`** to deliver grounded cultural tips (RAG-style)\n- **Python CLI Chat Loop** that mimics real chatbot experience in a Kaggle Notebook\n- **Show Markdown Renderer** that formats all AI responses in readable, friendly Markdown\n- **Modular Intent Handlers** like `handle_get_weather`, `handle_plan_itinerary`, etc.\n- **Session Memory** for last city and user travel preferences\n- **LLM-Based Evaluation System** that gives each itinerary a “Travel Score” and feedback on weather fit, personalization, balance, and authenticity\n\n---\n\n## ✨ Functionality\n\nTravelAIAgent supports a wide range of features, including:\n\n- **🌦 Weather Info** — current and 5-day forecast using Gemini summaries  \n- **🧳 Travel & Cultural Tips** — grounded tips from 30+ cities via vector search + RAG  \n- **🎟 Event Discovery** — find what's happening near you using Ticketmaster API  \n- **🗺 Itinerary Generator** — builds personalized plans using your preferences, weather, and events  \n- **🧠 Itinerary Evaluator (Gen AI)** — TravelAIAgent self-assesses its own plans with a “🌍 Travel Score” out of 10  \n- **🖼 Landmark Descriptions** — upload a photo and get a tourist-style explanation  \n- **📺 YouTube Video Summarizer** — provide a chatbot with a video URL to get a summary. Insights are remembered to tailor your itinerary.  \n- **📸 OCR & Translation** — extract and translate any text from images (e.g., signs, menus)  \n- **❓ Travel Quiz** — answer a few fun questions about your style, budget, and food preferences. Get matched with a perfect destination and a warm explanation of why it suits you.  \n- **💾 Memory** — remembers your likes and city history to make smarter suggestions  \n- **📝 Export Itineraries** — choose to save as `.md` or `.pdf` right after generation. It's also possible to export itineraries to `.json` (use `.txt` format for that)  \n- **📤 Export Full Chat History** — just type `!export` anytime  \n\n---\n\nNotes:\n- 🛠 **Setup required:** Enter your API keys and run all setup cells first.\n- 📁 **Photo processing:** Attach a Kaggle dataset named `photos` for image features to work. Upload photos in .png format. To use photos, reference them by name like \"Hey AI, can you translate the text you see in fileName.png?\", \"What do I see on fileName.png?\", etc.\n- ✨ **Export:** Use `!export` to save full chat history or export itineraries post-generation.\n- ❌ **Exit options:** Use `!quit`, `!q`, or `quit` to end the chat.\n\nEnjoy your trip planning with TravelAIAgent in the last section of the notebook named **\"Chat with TravelAIAgent\"** 🌍✈️","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# TravelAIAgent: Setup 🛠️\nFirst, install ChromaDB and the Gemini API Python SDK.

To handle this, we use a technique called function routing, powered by Gemini.\n\nThe interpret_user_request() function acts as the brain of this routing system. It sends the user's message to Gemini with a carefully crafted prompt that explains how to classify the input. The prompt includes examples of how to convert natural language into a structured Python dictionary, such as: {'intent': 'get_weather', 'location': 'Paris'} or {'intent': 'plan_itinerary', 'location': 'Rome', 'days': 3, 'when': 'next week'} or {'intent': 'get_tip', 'query': 'public transport in Tokyo'}\n\nGemini then replies with a dictionary string, and we use Python’s ast.literal_eval() to safely convert that string into a real Python dictionary. This dictionary tells the assistant which intent to handle, and which handler function to trigger.\nIf something goes wrong — such as Gemini returning an invalid dictionary — we default to a generic 'chat' intent, so the assistant can still respond gracefully.\n\n---\n\n## 🏙️ Extracting City Names\nSometimes users don’t explicitly state a city in a clean format, especially when asking for travel tips or events. To improve contextual understanding, we use the extract_city_from_text() function. This is a lightweight utility that asks Gemini to pull a city name from any given sentence.\n\nFor example:\n“Tell me more about Zurich” → returns \"Zurich\", “What can I do there?” → returns \"None\"\n\nIt helps ensure the assistant tracks which city is being discussed, so it can recall that later (e.g. when asked \"What's the weather like there?\").

Instead of just dumping raw data, it prepares a natural-language summary with the help of Gemini. The API response is parsed to extract key weather details like: Current temperature, Feels-like temperature, Humidity, Wind speed, General weather description. Then, a prompt is crafted to instruct Gemini to summarize this like a local travel agent would — conversational, helpful, and using emojis where appropriate.\\\nFor example:\n“It’s around 15°C in Lisbon right now with a nice breeze and clear skies — perfect for walking the old town! 🌤️👟”\nThis makes the response feel more human and trip-relevant, not just like reading numbers.\n\n**get_weather_summary(city) – 5-Day Forecast**\\\nInstead of a snapshot, this function gathers a multi-day forecast from OpenWeather, broken into 3-hour segments across five days.

It uses Gemini 1.5 Pro’s multimodal vision model, which is capable of reading embedded text from real-world photos.\\\nThe function opens the image file in binary mode, attaches it to a prompt asking Gemini to extract all visible text (but not translate), and then returns the raw string. This step is useful when the goal is to understand what’s written in a local language before translating or explaining it.\n\n**translate_to_english(text) – Text Translation** 🌐🗣️\\\nOnce the text is extracted from an image, we pass it to this function, which uses Gemini 2.0 Flash to translate it into English. The prompt is simple and direct: translate the following text.\\\nThis lets users take photos of signs, menus, schedules, or maps and instantly understand what they mean — perfect for tourists navigating unfamiliar environments.\\\nFor example: A French street sign like \"Rue des Bourneaux\" → \"Bourneaux Street\"\n\n**describe_photo(file_path) – Landmark and Scene Description** 🏛️✨\\\nThis function goes beyond OCR and answers a higher-level question: “What am I looking at?”\\\nIt uses Gemini 1.5 Pro to analyze the image and describe the scene, including its possible cultural or historical context.

This section combines ChromaDB (a vector database), Gemini embeddings, and Gemini's language generation to bring real-world knowledge into the assistant's responses.\n\n**🧳 documents – Curated Travel Tips**\\\nWe start with a hardcoded list of helpful, city-specific cultural tips and travel advice. These act as a lightweight knowledge base. Each item is a short, practical sentence — perfect for answering questions like: “What should I know before going to Tokyo?”, “Is it okay to haggle in Marrakech?”\n\n**🧠 GeminiEmbeddingFunction – Semantic Understanding**\\\nTo search through these tips in a meaningful way, we embed both the tips and the user's queries using Gemini's text-embedding-004 model. This converts text into high-dimensional vectors that capture their semantic meaning. The class supports two modes: \"retrieval_document\" – for indexing passages and \"retrieval_query\" – for embedding the user's question. This ensures the model can retrieve relevant advice even if the user asks in a different phrasing than what’s stored.\n\n**🗃️ chroma_client + chromaDB – Embedding Storage**\\\nWe initialize a ChromaDB collection named \"travel_tips\", embed the list of tips, and store them by unique IDs. This allows the assistant to quickly search for tips that are most relevant to the user's question at runtime.\n\n**❓ search_and_answer(user_question) – RAG Answering**\\\nWhen a user asks for tips or cultural context: The function switches to query mode -> Finds the top 2 semantically similar tips from ChromaDB -> Passes those into Gemini 2.0 Flash using a prompt that instructs it to generate a helpful, grounded answer. This pattern ensures that answers are both relevant and informed by the actual data — a key aspect of building trust in AI assistants. In case of missing suggestion for particular city, the function asks LLM to provide user with tips.\n\n**🖼️ Image Insights: photo_collection + search_photo_insights()**\\\nWe use the same RAG pipeline to store and query descriptions of user-uploaded photos (e.g. landmarks, statues, monuments). After describing a photo using Gemini Vision, the description is embedded and added to a separate collection (photo_insights). Then, if the user asks: “What is that building?” or “What’s the story behind this statue?”. We use search_photo_insights() to pull relevant image descriptions from the vector DB and let Gemini answer based on that context.\n\nTogether, these components turn your assistant into a context-aware, grounded travel expert.

Executes a specific capability (like getting weather or generating an itinerary)\n2. Updates the assistant’s memory if needed (e.g. storing the last mentioned city)\n3. Prints and stores the response in the conversation history\n\n---\n\n**🌤️ handle_get_weather & handle_get_weather_forecast**\\\nThese handlers fetch current conditions or a 5-day forecast from OpenWeather and summarize it using Gemini. They store the city as memory[\"last_city\"] so the assistant can reference it later when the user says, “What’s the weather like there?”\n\n**🧳 handle_get_tip**\\\nThis pulls grounded cultural advice from ChromaDB using a RAG-style query. It also extracts and stores the city mentioned in the user’s tip-related question to maintain context.\n\n**📸 handle_describe_photo, handle_ask_about_photo, handle_image_translate**\\\nThese three handlers handle photo-related requests:\n1. describe_photo: Uses Gemini Vision to describe what’s in an uploaded image (e.g. a statue or landmark)\n2. ask_about_photo: Allows follow-up questions using photo-based RAG from ChromaDB\n3. image_translate: Extracts and translates visible text from a photo (e.g. street signs or menus)\nThey help users understand and interact with their surroundings more easily, especially in unfamiliar places.\n\n**🌆 handle_get_events**\\\nThis fetches events in a city using the Ticketmaster Discovery API and summarizes them using Gemini. The results feel natural and tailored — great for finding things to do on the fly.\n\n**🧠 handle_get_weather_last & handle_get_last_city**\\\nThese support context-awareness. If the user asks: “What’s the weather like there?” or “Which city was I talking about?”. The assistant responds intelligently based on the memory dictionary (memory[\"last_city\"]), maintaining a natural and coherent conversation flow.\n\n**📺 handle_summarize_youtube**\\\nThis handler brings video understanding to TravelAIAgent by enabling users to submit a YouTube link — usually a travel vlog or destination video — and receive a smart, friendly summary of its content:\n1. The video is passed to Gemini 1.5's video understanding API via `summarize_yt(link)`.\n2. Gemini generates a high-level summary.\n3. The summary is then shown to the user in a clean Markdown format.\n4. It’s saved in memory as `memory[\"video_summary\"]` so it can **personalize future itineraries**.\n\n---\n\n🧠 **LLM-Based Self-Evaluation**: After the itinerary is generated, TravelAIAgent passes it back to Gemini for **self-assessment**. The model scores the itinerary on:\n- Balance between indoor/outdoor activities\n- Cultural authenticity\n- Weather suitability\n- Personalization based on your preferences\n\nGemini then responds with a 🌍 **Travel Score out of 10**, plus helpful feedback. This makes it easy for users to assess the quality of the plan, catch gaps, and get suggestions — making the experience more trustworthy and intelligent.\n\n**🗺️ handle_plan_itinerary**\nThis is one of the most impressive handlers — it builds a personalized, multi-day itinerary by combining:\n\n1. 🌦️ Real-time multi-day **weather forecasts**\n2. 🧳 Cultural **travel tips** retrieved using **ChromaDB + Gemini embeddings**\n3. 💬 **User preferences** (gathered naturally during conversation and stored in memory)\n4. 🎟️ Local **event listings** using the Ticketmaster Discovery API\n\nThe handler intelligently estimates the trip start date based on natural language like \"next week\" or \"this weekend\", and then assembles all relevant information into a prompt that Gemini uses to generate a highly tailored itinerary.\n\n---\n\n✨ **Export Features**: After generating the itinerary, the user is automatically asked whether they'd like to export it. If yes, the plan and evaluation can be saved in:\n- 📄 **Markdown format (.md)**\n- 📄 **PDF format** (beautifully rendered with basic formatting)\n- The bot also supports a `!export` command at any time during the session to export the entire **chat history** (including both user inputs and AI responses) into a `.md` file. This makes it easy to revisit recommendations, itinerary details, or planning discussions.\n- When exporting the itinerary to a file, user **must** include the format of a file in a filename i.e **travelItinerary.md** or **travelItinerary.pdf**\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import json\n# Handlers\ndef handle_get_weather(action, history, memory):\n    city = action[\"location\"]\n    memory[\"last_city\"] = city\n    weather_info = get_weather(city)\n    show_response(types.ModelContent(parts=[types.Part.from_text(text=weather_info)]))\n    history.append(types.ModelContent(parts=[types.Part.from_text(text=weather_info)]))\n\ndef handle_get_tip(action, history, memory):\n    query = action[\"query\"]\n    city = extract_city_from_text(query)\n    memory[\"last_city\"] = city if city else query\n    tip_answer = search_and_answer(query)\n    show_response(types.ModelContent(parts=[types.Part.from_text(text=tip_answer)]))\n    history.append(types.ModelContent(parts=[types.Part.from_text(text=tip_answer)]))\n\ndef handle_describe_photo(action, history):\n    filename = action[\"filename\"]\n    filepath = f\"/kaggle/input/photos/{filename}\"\n\n    try:\n        with open(filepath, \"rb\") as f:\n            f.read(1)\n        if filename not in photo_collection.get()['ids']:\n            description = describe_photo(filepath)\n            add_photo_description_to_chromadb(photo_id=filename, description=description)\n            show_response(types.ModelContent(parts=[types.Part.from_text(text=description)]))\n            history.append(types.ModelContent(parts=[types.Part.from_text(text=description)]))\n        else:\n            print(f\"🤖 TravelAIAgent: I already have a description for `{filename}`.\")\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"🤖 TravelAIAgent: I couldn't find the image `{filename}` in /kaggle/input/photos/.\")\n\ndef handle_ask_about_photo(user_input, history):\n    if not photo_collection.get()['documents']:\n        print(\"🤖 TravelAIAgent: I haven’t analyzed any photos yet.

It’s where everything comes together — intent recognition, memory tracking, handler dispatching, and fallback chat (Send \"!q\" or \"!quit! or \"quit\" to end chat). Here's how it works:\n\n---\n\n**🕘 history and memory Initialization**\\\nThe assistant starts with two critical variables:\n1. history: a list that stores the full back-and-forth conversation (in Gemini’s expected format). It keeps context across turns.\n2. memory: a dictionary that stores session-specific context like: last_city: the most recently mentioned city (used for follow-ups like \"What's the weather like there?\"), and  preferences: any user-specified likes (e.g. “I love seafood”) that guide future responses\n\n---\n**👋 First Impression: Onboarding Message**\\\nThe assistant prints a warm welcome using the onboarding_message and also adds it to the conversation history. This sets the tone and immediately informs the user of the assistant’s capabilities.\n\n---\n\n**🔁 The Main Loop**\\\nThis is a while True: loop that simulates ongoing conversation. Each time the user enters input: User message is read and cleaned, and intent is interpreted using interpret_user_request()\n\nThe assistant routes the request to the appropriate handler: Weather, Cultural tips, Photo analysis, Event search, Itinerary planning, Translation, Memory recall, Handlers take care of fetching data, calling APIs, or prompting Gemini, then store the result back in history.\n\n---\n\n**🧠 Fallback Branch**\\\nIf none of the intent matches are triggered (e.g. the user says something casual or vague): The input is added to history, Gemini is called with full context to continue the conversation naturally. Optionally, if the user shares a preference (e.g. \"I love museums\"), it’s stored in memory[\"preferences\"] for future personalization. A try/except block ensures any Gemini API failures are handled gracefully without breaking the loop — offering a friendly error instead of a crash.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def start_travel_chat():\n    history = []\n    memory = {\n        \"last_city\": None,\n        \"preferences\": []\n    }\n    onboarding_block = types.ModelContent(parts=[types.Part.from_text(text=onboarding_message)])\n    history.append(onboarding_block)\n    show_response(onboarding_block)\n    \n    # Main loop\n    while True:\n        user_input = input(\"👤 You:\").strip()\n        \n        # Menu options\n        # Quit - Use !q, !quit or quit to end the conversation.\n        if user_input.strip().lower() in ['!q', 'quit', '!quit']:\n            print(\"Thanks for using TravelAIAgent.

Make sure to complete the **Setup** section of this notebook before testing:\n\n---\n\n🌦️ Weather\n- Ask for the **current weather** in any city  \n  _Example:_ `What's the weather like in Paris right now?`\n\n- Ask for a **weather forecast** for upcoming days  \n  _Example:_ `What's the weather like in Tokyo next week?`\n\n🧳 Travel Tips\n- Ask for **local travel tips, etiquette, or advice**  \n  _Example:_ `What should I know before traveling to Istanbul?`\n\n🖼️ Image Understanding\n- Upload a photo to the `/kaggle/input/photos/` dataset and ask for a **tourist-style description**  \n  _Example:_ `What’s in RoseGarden.png?`\n\n- Upload a photo with a **non-English sign or menu** and ask for a translation  \n  _Example:_ `Can you translate text from \"menu_japan.png\"?`\n\n🎟️ Events\n- Ask about **events happening today, this weekend, or a specific date**  \n  _Example:_ `What are some events happening in Los Angeles this weekend?`\n\n💬 Preferences & Memory\n- Tell the chatbot your **travel style or food preferences**  \n  _Example:_ `I love seafood and art museums.`  \n  _These are remembered and used when building personalized itineraries._\n\n📺 YouTube Video Summarizer  \n- Share a **YouTube link** to a travel vlog or destination video.  \n  The chatbot will **analyze** the video and **summarize** key moments, places visited, the vibe, and tips shared.  \n  This info is **stored in memory** and used later when creating your personalized travel itinerary.\\\n  _Example:_ `Can you summarize this travel video? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=*********`\n\n🗺️ Itinerary Generation\n- Ask the assistant to generate a **multi-day travel itinerary**  \n  _Example:_ `Create a travel itinerary for Rome for 5 days starting next weekend.`\n\n- After generating the plan, **evaluate it with LLM-powered scoring**  \n  _Example:_ _(done automatically)_ You'll see a 🌍 Travel Score with feedback.\n\n- **Export** your generated itinerary in Markdown or PDF format  \n  _When prompted, choose \"markdown\" or \"pdf\" to save the file locally._\n\n📤 Chat History Export\n- Type `!export` to save the **entire conversation** (user + AI responses) into a `.md` file  \n  _Great for trip planning logs and sharing!_\n\n🎮 Travel Quiz  \n- Try the **Travel Quiz** to get a travel recommendation based on your preferences and knowledge.  \n  _Example:_ `Let's take a travel quiz to find my next destination!`","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 🌍 Why This Matters\n\nTravel planning today is fragmented — travelers juggle multiple apps for weather, translation, event discovery, local tips, and itinerary building. This project brings everything together into one intelligent, multimodal assistant.\n\n**TravelAIAgent** uses state-of-the-art Generative AI not just to answer questions, but to act like a smart, well-traveled companion. It understands natural language, interprets photos and videos, recommends activities based on real-time data, and even critiques its own suggestions. With features like image OCR, cultural RAG tips, YouTube video summarization, and itinerary evaluation — it showcases how GenAI can go beyond chat and solve real-world problems.\n\nThis matters because it demonstrates the future of AI assistants: grounded, contextual, and capable of understanding the world the way humans do — through sights, language, experiences, and preferences.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 🪲 Limitations and future work\nTravelAIAgent is not perfect and can make mistakes. It learns and becomes better day-by-day. One day it'll be very smart! 🙂\\\nOverall, it's really good for requests related to current and upcoming day (e.g weather now, events now, itirenary for upcoming 3 days, etc.)\n\n**Bugs:**\\\nEvents:\n- \"What are some events happening in *** this Sunday\" - Can not process \"this Sunday\" properly and falls back to current day.\n- Event handler does not know your current time zone so it might produce confusing results including previous days.\n- Event handler is not able to process multi-day requests, but it will try it's best to do so when generating multi-day itinerary.\n- Event handler might be confused overall with future days. This is because of TicketMaster's API.\n\nItinerary:\n- Itinerary generated by user is not being saved in memory, so if user declines exporting, the itinerary will be lost unless user prompts chatbot to generate a new one.\n\n**Future work:**\n- Printing the results, displaying markdown and memory updates can be streamlined (combined/refactored)\n- Addition of voice input/output\n- Fine-tuning using travel/tourism dataset\n- Implement trip planner\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 🙋‍♂️ Conclusion\n\nTravelAIAgent demonstrates how Generative AI can transform travel planning into a smarter, more personalized experience. By combining language understanding, image and video analysis, real-time APIs, and self-evaluation, this assistant goes beyond simple Q&A — it acts as a true travel companion.\n\nFrom recommending events and generating itineraries to translating street signs and summarizing travel vlogs, TravelAIAgent showcases the powerful synergy of multimodal AI and real-world utility.\n\nIt was a truly enriching experience participating in Google's 5-day Gen AI Intensive Course. This intensive program not only introduced me to the fascinating realm of Agentic AI but also equipped me with the essential tools and foundational knowledge to effectively leverage Gemini-powered agents in my own projects.\n\nWorking on this TravelAgentAI LLM assistant within the Kaggle environment has been an exciting journey, and I see tremendous potential for the implementation of these intelligent technologies across various facets of our daily lives. I am deeply grateful to the Google team for providing such comprehensive learning materials and for their ongoing research and development in the field of Agentic AI. Can't wait to use Gemini in my future personal projects!\n\nThank you for exploring this project — and bon voyage! ✈️🌍\\\nSincerely,\\\nRamis Hasanli","metadata":{}}]}
