It combines real-time weather and event data, image understanding, user preferences, and grounded travel knowledge to deliver an intelligent, personalized travel experience. Users are able to interact with chatbot in last section of this notebook. Do not skip setup part.\n\n## üß† What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nPlanning a trip often involves jumping between apps ‚Äî weather forecasts, events calendars, translation tools, tourist guides, and more. Many travelers also struggle to get real-time, personalized advice while already on the move.\n\n**TravelAIAgent solves this by acting like a smart, always-available travel agent** that:\n- Understands natural language queries and photos\n- Offers contextual suggestions tailored to the user‚Äôs preferences\n- Uses real-time data (e.g., events, weather) to enhance planning\n- Generates complete itineraries, answers travel questions, and guides users through unfamiliar locations\n\nThe result is a smoother, more interactive travel experience ‚Äî whether you're planning in advance or exploring on the go.\n\n---\n\n## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works: Architecture and Core Design\n\nThe assistant uses **intent-based routing** to understand what the user is asking, then routes requests to specialized modules that handle tasks like weather forecasting, itinerary generation, photo analysis, and event lookup.\n\n### üîß Key Components:\n- **Gemini 2.0 Flash & 1.5 Pro Vision** ‚Äì for language and image understanding\n- **OpenWeather API** ‚Äì for current weather and multi-day forecasts\n- **Ticketmaster Discovery API** ‚Äì to fetch local events\n- **ChromaDB + `text-embedding-004`** ‚Äì to retrieve grounded cultural tips (RAG)\n- **Python CLI loop** ‚Äì simulates interactive chat experience (notebook-friendly)\n- **Modular intent handlers** ‚Äì clean structure to process user requests\n\n---\n\n## ‚ú® Functionality\n\nTravelAIAgent supports a wide range of features, including:\n\n- **üå¶ Real-time weather updates** and multi-day forecasts with Gemini-powered summaries\n- **üß≥ Travel tips and cultural insights** for 30+ cities via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\n- **üéü Local event discovery** using Ticketmaster's API, summarized by Gemini\n- **üó∫ Personalized itinerary generation**, combining forecast, events, travel tips, and user preferences\n- **üñºÔ∏è Tourist photo understanding**, including landmark descriptions and cultural context\n- **üì∏ Text extraction and translation** from uploaded photos (e.g., signs, menus)\n- **üß† Session memory** of user preferences and previously mentioned cities\n\nAll responses are generated in a natural, friendly tone ‚Äî just like a helpful travel agent might speak.\n\n---\n\n### To Interact with Travel Agent you need to set up API keys and click \"Run All\". See last section of the notebook.\n### Users can create dataset called \"photos\" and attach it to this notebook. This allows TravelAgent to process photos.\n### Copyright: No copy allowed before April 21 2025","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# TravelAIAgent: Setup üõ†Ô∏è\nFirst, install ChromaDB and the Gemini API Python SDK.

To handle this, we use a technique called function routing, powered by Gemini.\n\nThe interpret_user_request() function acts as the brain of this routing system. It sends the user's message to Gemini with a carefully crafted prompt that explains how to classify the input. The prompt includes examples of how to convert natural language into a structured Python dictionary, such as: {'intent': 'get_weather', 'location': 'Paris'} or {'intent': 'plan_itinerary', 'location': 'Rome', 'days': 3, 'when': 'next week'} or {'intent': 'get_tip', 'query': 'public transport in Tokyo'}\n\nGemini then replies with a dictionary string, and we use Python‚Äôs ast.literal_eval() to safely convert that string into a real Python dictionary. This dictionary tells the assistant which intent to handle, and which handler function to trigger.\nIf something goes wrong ‚Äî such as Gemini returning an invalid dictionary ‚Äî we default to a generic 'chat' intent, so the assistant can still respond gracefully.\n\n---\n\n## üèôÔ∏è Extracting City Names\nSometimes users don‚Äôt explicitly state a city in a clean format, especially when asking for travel tips or events. To improve contextual understanding, we use the extract_city_from_text() function. This is a lightweight utility that asks Gemini to pull a city name from any given sentence.\n\nFor example:\n‚ÄúTell me more about Zurich‚Äù ‚Üí returns \"Zurich\", ‚ÄúWhat can I do there?‚Äù ‚Üí returns \"None\"\n\nIt helps ensure the assistant tracks which city is being discussed, so it can recall that later (e.g. when asked \"What's the weather like there?\").

Instead of just dumping raw data, it prepares a natural-language summary with the help of Gemini. The API response is parsed to extract key weather details like: Current temperature, Feels-like temperature, Humidity, Wind speed, General weather description. Then, a prompt is crafted to instruct Gemini to summarize this like a local travel agent would ‚Äî conversational, helpful, and using emojis where appropriate.\\\nFor example:\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs around 15¬∞C in Lisbon right now with a nice breeze and clear skies ‚Äî perfect for walking the old town! üå§Ô∏èüëü‚Äù\nThis makes the response feel more human and trip-relevant, not just like reading numbers.\n\n**get_weather_summary(city) ‚Äì 5-Day Forecast**\\\nInstead of a snapshot, this function gathers a multi-day forecast from OpenWeather, broken into 3-hour segments across five days.

The result is a travel assistant that can read and interpret photos like a human guide would.\\\n**User can upload photos (.png) to Kaggle dataseet named \"photos\" and attach it to this notebook. This will allow Travel Agent to interact with photos. To reference the photo in chat, user needs to use followig format \"imgName.png\".

It uses Gemini 1.5 Pro‚Äôs multimodal vision model, which is capable of reading embedded text from real-world photos.\\\nThe function opens the image file in binary mode, attaches it to a prompt asking Gemini to extract all visible text (but not translate), and then returns the raw string. This step is useful when the goal is to understand what‚Äôs written in a local language before translating or explaining it.\n\n**translate_to_english(text) ‚Äì Text Translation** üåêüó£Ô∏è\\\nOnce the text is extracted from an image, we pass it to this function, which uses Gemini 2.0 Flash to translate it into English.

This section combines ChromaDB (a vector database), Gemini embeddings, and Gemini's language generation to bring real-world knowledge into the assistant's responses.\n\n**üß≥ documents ‚Äì Curated Travel Tips**\\\nWe start with a hardcoded list of helpful, city-specific cultural tips and travel advice.

This converts text into high-dimensional vectors that capture their semantic meaning. The class supports two modes: \"retrieval_document\" ‚Äì for indexing passages and \"retrieval_query\" ‚Äì for embedding the user's question. This ensures the model can retrieve relevant advice even if the user asks in a different phrasing than what‚Äôs stored.\n\n**üóÉÔ∏è chroma_client + chromaDB ‚Äì Embedding Storage**\\\nWe initialize a ChromaDB collection named \"travel_tips\", embed the list of tips, and store them by unique IDs. This allows the assistant to quickly search for tips that are most relevant to the user's question at runtime.\n\n**‚ùì search_and_answer(user_question) ‚Äì RAG Answering**\\\nWhen a user asks for tips or cultural context: The function switches to query mode -> Finds the top 2 semantically similar tips from ChromaDB -> Passes those into Gemini 2.0 Flash using a prompt that instructs it to generate a helpful, grounded answer. This pattern ensures that answers are both relevant and informed by the actual data ‚Äî a key aspect of building trust in AI assistants. In case of missing suggestion for particular city, the function asks LLM to provide user with tips.\n\n**üñºÔ∏è Image Insights: photo_collection + search_photo_insights()**\\\nWe use the same RAG pipeline to store and query descriptions of user-uploaded photos (e.g. landmarks, statues, monuments). After describing a photo using Gemini Vision, the description is embedded and added to a separate collection (photo_insights). Then, if the user asks: ‚ÄúWhat is that building?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the story behind this statue?‚Äù. We use search_photo_insights() to pull relevant image descriptions from the vector DB and let Gemini answer based on that context.\n\nTogether, these components turn your assistant into a context-aware, grounded travel expert.

It‚Äôs where everything comes together ‚Äî intent recognition, memory tracking, handler dispatching, and fallback chat. Here's how it works:\n\n---\n\n**üïò history and memory Initialization**\\\nThe assistant starts with two critical variables:\n1. history: a list that stores the full back-and-forth conversation (in Gemini‚Äôs expected format). It keeps context across turns.\n2. memory: a dictionary that stores session-specific context like: last_city: the most recently mentioned city (used for follow-ups like \"What's the weather like there?\"), and  preferences: any user-specified likes (e.g. ‚ÄúI love seafood‚Äù) that guide future responses\n\n---\n**üëã First Impression: Onboarding Message**\\\nThe assistant prints a warm welcome using the onboarding_message and also adds it to the conversation history. This sets the tone and immediately informs the user of the assistant‚Äôs capabilities.\n\n---\n\n**üîÅ The Main Loop**\\\nThis is a while True: loop that simulates ongoing conversation. Each time the user enters input: User message is read and cleaned, and intent is interpreted using interpret_user_request()\n\nThe assistant routes the request to the appropriate handler: Weather, Cultural tips, Photo analysis, Event search, Itinerary planning, Translation, Memory recall, Handlers take care of fetching data, calling APIs, or prompting Gemini, then store the result back in history.\n\n---\n\n**üß† Fallback Branch**\\\nIf none of the intent matches are triggered (e.g. the user says something casual or vague): The input is added to history, Gemini is called with full context to continue the conversation naturally. Optionally, if the user shares a preference (e.g. \"I love museums\"), it‚Äôs stored in memory[\"preferences\"] for future personalization. A try/except block ensures any Gemini API failures are handled gracefully without breaking the loop ‚Äî offering a friendly error instead of a crash.","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def start_travel_chat():\n    history = []\n    memory = {\n        \"last_city\": None,\n        \"preferences\": []\n    }\n    onboarding_block = types.ModelContent(parts=[types.Part.from_text(text=onboarding_message)])\n    history.append(onboarding_block)\n    show_response(onboarding_block)\n    \n    # Main loop\n    while True:\n        user_input = input(\"üë§ You:\").strip()\n        \n        # Menu options\n        # Quit\n        if user_input.strip().lower() in ['!q', 'quit', '!quit']:\n            print(\"Thanks for using TravelAIAgent.
