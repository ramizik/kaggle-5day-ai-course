It combines real-time weather and event data, image understanding, user preferences, and grounded travel knowledge to deliver an intelligent, personalized travel experience. Users are able to interact with chatbot in last section of this notebook. Do not skip setup part.\n\n## 🧠 What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nPlanning a trip often involves jumping between apps — weather forecasts, events calendars, translation tools, tourist guides, and more. Many travelers also struggle to get real-time, personalized advice while already on the move.\n\n**TravelAIAgent solves this by acting like a smart, always-available travel agent** that:\n- Understands natural language queries and photos\n- Offers contextual suggestions tailored to the user’s preferences\n- Uses real-time data (e.g., events, weather) to enhance planning\n- Generates complete itineraries, answers travel questions, and guides users through unfamiliar locations\n\nThe result is a smoother, more interactive travel experience — whether you're planning in advance or exploring on the go.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How It Works: Architecture and Core Design\n\nThe assistant uses **intent-based routing** to understand what the user is asking, then routes requests to specialized modules that handle tasks like weather forecasting, itinerary generation, photo analysis, and event lookup.\n\n### 🔧 Key Components:\n- **Gemini 2.0 Flash & 1.5 Pro Vision** – for language and image understanding\n- **OpenWeather API** – for current weather and multi-day forecasts\n- **Ticketmaster Discovery API** – to fetch local events\n- **ChromaDB + `text-embedding-004`** – to retrieve grounded cultural tips (RAG)\n- **Python CLI loop** – simulates interactive chat experience (notebook-friendly)\n- **Modular intent handlers** – clean structure to process user requests\n\n---\n\n## ✨ Functionality\n\nTravelAIAgent supports a wide range of features, including:\n\n- **🌦 Real-time weather updates** and multi-day forecasts with Gemini-powered summaries\n- **🧳 Travel tips and cultural insights** for 30+ cities via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\n- **🎟 Local event discovery** using Ticketmaster's API, summarized by Gemini\n- **🗺 Personalized itinerary generation**, combining forecast, events, travel tips, and user preferences\n- **🖼️ Tourist photo understanding**, including landmark descriptions and cultural context\n- **📸 Text extraction and translation** from uploaded photos (e.g., signs, menus)\n- **🧠 Session memory** of user preferences and previously mentioned cities\n\nAll responses are generated in a natural, friendly tone — just like a helpful travel agent might speak.\n\n---\n\n### To Interact with Travel Agent you need to set up API keys and click \"Run All\". See last section of the notebook.\n### Users can create dataset called \"photos\" and attach it to this notebook. This allows TravelAgent to process photos.\n### Copyright: No copy allowed before April 21 2025","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# TravelAIAgent: Setup 🛠️\nFirst, install ChromaDB and the Gemini API Python SDK.

It's part of Gemini's **system instruction** capability — a powerful way to steer tone, style, and behavior of the model. Here, we tell the assistant to act like a friendly, well-traveled guide who gives practical, friendly advice with just the right amount of emojis. It also encourages the bot to remember preferences the user shares and to speak like a helpful person — not a robot.\n\nThis instruction is passed into the Gemini API's config to control every future response the assistant generates.\n\n---\n\n### `onboarding_message` 👋\n\nThis is the first message the user sees when launching the chatbot — kind of like the assistant's welcome pitch. It sets expectations for what the assistant can help with: weather, tips, events, image translation, itinerary planning, and more. The list-style format, combined with emojis, keeps it light and easy to read.

To handle this, we use a technique called function routing, powered by Gemini.\n\nThe interpret_user_request() function acts as the brain of this routing system. It sends the user's message to Gemini with a carefully crafted prompt that explains how to classify the input. The prompt includes examples of how to convert natural language into a structured Python dictionary, such as: {'intent': 'get_weather', 'location': 'Paris'} or {'intent': 'plan_itinerary', 'location': 'Rome', 'days': 3, 'when': 'next week'} or {'intent': 'get_tip', 'query': 'public transport in Tokyo'}\n\nGemini then replies with a dictionary string, and we use Python’s ast.literal_eval() to safely convert that string into a real Python dictionary. This dictionary tells the assistant which intent to handle, and which handler function to trigger.\nIf something goes wrong — such as Gemini returning an invalid dictionary — we default to a generic 'chat' intent, so the assistant can still respond gracefully.\n\n---\n\n## 🏙️ Extracting City Names\nSometimes users don’t explicitly state a city in a clean format, especially when asking for travel tips or events. To improve contextual understanding, we use the extract_city_from_text() function. This is a lightweight utility that asks Gemini to pull a city name from any given sentence.\n\nFor example:\n“Tell me more about Zurich” → returns \"Zurich\", “What can I do there?” → returns \"None\"\n\nIt helps ensure the assistant tracks which city is being discussed, so it can recall that later (e.g. when asked \"What's the weather like there?\"). This adds a subtle layer of memory and personalization to the interaction, without requiring complex NER models or external parsers.","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# BETA\n# Show response\nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown, Image\n\ndef show_response(response, label=\"🤖 TravelAIAgent said\"):\n    # Show label as Markdown header\n    if label:\n        display(Markdown(f\"**{label}:**\"))\n\n    for p in response.parts:\n        if p.text:\n            display(Markdown(p.text))\n        elif p.inline_data:\n            display(Image(p.inline_data.data))\n        else:\n            print(p.to_json_dict())\n\n    display(Markdown('----'))\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-17T21:48:49.020065Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-17T21:48:49.020345Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-17T21:48:49.026585Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-17T21:48:49.020324Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-17T21:48:49.025627Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":24},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import ast\n\ndef interpret_user_request(user_input):\n    prompt = (\n        \"You are a function router.

Instead of just dumping raw data, it prepares a natural-language summary with the help of Gemini. The API response is parsed to extract key weather details like: Current temperature, Feels-like temperature, Humidity, Wind speed, General weather description. Then, a prompt is crafted to instruct Gemini to summarize this like a local travel agent would — conversational, helpful, and using emojis where appropriate.\\\nFor example:\n“It’s around 15°C in Lisbon right now with a nice breeze and clear skies — perfect for walking the old town! 🌤️👟”\nThis makes the response feel more human and trip-relevant, not just like reading numbers.\n\n**get_weather_summary(city) – 5-Day Forecast**\\\nInstead of a snapshot, this function gathers a multi-day forecast from OpenWeather, broken into 3-hour segments across five days. The forecast entries are grouped by date, and then passed to Gemini in a structured format. The LLM is asked to: Summarize the general vibe of each day, highlight rain or great outdoor weather, and recommend the best days for activities. This is especially useful when building itineraries, since it helps the assistant match sunny days with walking tours or outdoor activities, and reserve indoor options for rainy ones.\\\nFor example:\n“Tuesday looks rainy 🌧️ — maybe plan some museum time.

This step is useful when the goal is to understand what’s written in a local language before translating or explaining it.\n\n**translate_to_english(text) – Text Translation** 🌐🗣️\\\nOnce the text is extracted from an image, we pass it to this function, which uses Gemini 2.0 Flash to translate it into English. The prompt is simple and direct: translate the following text.\\\nThis lets users take photos of signs, menus, schedules, or maps and instantly understand what they mean — perfect for tourists navigating unfamiliar environments.\\\nFor example: A French street sign like \"Rue des Bourneaux\" → \"Bourneaux Street\"\n\n**describe_photo(file_path) – Landmark and Scene Description** 🏛️✨\\\nThis function goes beyond OCR and answers a higher-level question: “What am I looking at?”\\\nIt uses Gemini 1.5 Pro to analyze the image and describe the scene, including its possible cultural or historical context. It’s especially useful for travel photos like landmarks, public art, or architecture. The prompt instructs Gemini to describe what’s in the image and why it might matter to a traveler — similar to how a museum guide or tour book would explain a location.\\\nFor example: Upload a photo of the Eiffel Tower → “This is the Eiffel Tower in Paris, an iconic symbol of France built for the 1889 World's Fair…”","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Extract text from image\ndef extract_text_from_image(file_path: str) -> str:\n    with open(file_path, \"rb\") as img:\n        image_bytes = img.read()\n\n    prompt = \"Extract all visible text from this image.

Whether you’re into concerts, theater, or cultural exhibits, the assistant uses this function to bring your itinerary to life with up-to-date entertainment options — all powered by the Ticketmaster Discovery API and summarized naturally using Gemini.\n\n**get_events(city, start_date, end_date, max_events) – Event Discovery + Summarization**\\\nThis function starts by querying the Ticketmaster Discovery API, using the name of the city and optional start/end date filters. It returns a list of upcoming events sorted by date — concerts, sports, exhibitions, shows, and more. We limit the number of results using max_events (default is 5) to avoid overwhelming the user and focus on the most relevant options. For each event, we extract key info such as name, date, venue\\\nInstead of listing raw data directly to the user, the assistant passes the list to Gemini 2.0 Flash using a well-crafted prompt. Gemini then summarizes the events in a casual, friendly tone — just like a travel agent would.\\\nFor example: “This week in San Francisco: balloon art exhibits, jazz at Birdland, and some Broadway action if you’re feeling theatrical. 🎷🎭”\\\nThe prompt also nudges Gemini to recommend which events suit different travelers (families, art lovers, music fans), highlight variety and uniqueness, and keep the tone fun and helpful","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def get_events(city: str, start_date: str = None, end_date: str = None, max_events: int = 5) -> str:\n    url = \"https://app.ticketmaster.com/discovery/v2/events.json\"\n\n    params = {\n        \"apikey\": EVENTS_API_KEY,\n        \"city\": city,\n        \"sort\": \"date,asc\",\n        \"locale\": \"*\",\n    }\n\n    if start_date:\n        params[\"startDateTime\"] = start_date\n    if end_date:\n        params[\"endDateTime\"] = end_date\n\n    response = requests.get(url, params=params)\n    if response.status_code != 200:\n        return f\"Sorry, I couldn't fetch events for {city}.\"\n\n    data = response.json()\n    events = data.get(\"_embedded\", {}).get(\"events\", [])[:max_events]\n\n    if not events:\n        return f\"No upcoming events found in {city}.\"\n\n    # Prepare input for Gemini\n    raw_event_lines = []\n    for event in events:\n        name = event.get(\"name\", \"Unnamed Event\")\n        date = event.get(\"dates\", {}).get(\"start\", {}).get(\"localDate\", \"Unknown Date\")\n        venue = event.get(\"_embedded\", {}).get(\"venues\", [{}])[0].get(\"name\", \"Unknown Venue\")\n        line = f\"{name} on {date} at {venue}\"\n        raw_event_lines.append(line)\n\n    event_input = \"\\n\".join(raw_event_lines)\n\n    # Gemini prompt\n    prompt = (\n    f\"You’re a cheerful travel assistant.

This section combines ChromaDB (a vector database), Gemini embeddings, and Gemini's language generation to bring real-world knowledge into the assistant's responses.\n\n**🧳 documents – Curated Travel Tips**\\\nWe start with a hardcoded list of helpful, city-specific cultural tips and travel advice. These act as a lightweight knowledge base. Each item is a short, practical sentence — perfect for answering questions like: “What should I know before going to Tokyo?”, “Is it okay to haggle in Marrakech?”\n\n**🧠 GeminiEmbeddingFunction – Semantic Understanding**\\\nTo search through these tips in a meaningful way, we embed both the tips and the user's queries using Gemini's text-embedding-004 model. This converts text into high-dimensional vectors that capture their semantic meaning. The class supports two modes: \"retrieval_document\" – for indexing passages and \"retrieval_query\" – for embedding the user's question. This ensures the model can retrieve relevant advice even if the user asks in a different phrasing than what’s stored.\n\n**🗃️ chroma_client + chromaDB – Embedding Storage**\\\nWe initialize a ChromaDB collection named \"travel_tips\", embed the list of tips, and store them by unique IDs. This allows the assistant to quickly search for tips that are most relevant to the user's question at runtime.\n\n**❓ search_and_answer(user_question) – RAG Answering**\\\nWhen a user asks for tips or cultural context: The function switches to query mode -> Finds the top 2 semantically similar tips from ChromaDB -> Passes those into Gemini 2.0 Flash using a prompt that instructs it to generate a helpful, grounded answer. This pattern ensures that answers are both relevant and informed by the actual data — a key aspect of building trust in AI assistants. In case of missing suggestion for particular city, the function asks LLM to provide user with tips.\n\n**🖼️ Image Insights: photo_collection + search_photo_insights()**\\\nWe use the same RAG pipeline to store and query descriptions of user-uploaded photos (e.g. landmarks, statues, monuments). After describing a photo using Gemini Vision, the description is embedded and added to a separate collection (photo_insights). Then, if the user asks: “What is that building?” or “What’s the story behind this statue?”. We use search_photo_insights() to pull relevant image descriptions from the vector DB and let Gemini answer based on that context.\n\nTogether, these components turn your assistant into a context-aware, grounded travel expert. It can recall city-specific etiquette, offer photo-based insight, and explain things like a human guide — all while staying efficient and scalable. ✈️🧠📸","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"documents = [\n    \"In Bangkok, visit Chatuchak Market on the weekend and avoid tuk-tuk scams near tourist spots.

It’s where everything comes together — intent recognition, memory tracking, handler dispatching, and fallback chat. Here's how it works:\n\n---\n\n**🕘 history and memory Initialization**\\\nThe assistant starts with two critical variables:\n1. history: a list that stores the full back-and-forth conversation (in Gemini’s expected format). It keeps context across turns.\n2. memory: a dictionary that stores session-specific context like: last_city: the most recently mentioned city (used for follow-ups like \"What's the weather like there?\"), and  preferences: any user-specified likes (e.g. “I love seafood”) that guide future responses\n\n---\n**👋 First Impression: Onboarding Message**\\\nThe assistant prints a warm welcome using the onboarding_message and also adds it to the conversation history. This sets the tone and immediately informs the user of the assistant’s capabilities.\n\n---\n\n**🔁 The Main Loop**\\\nThis is a while True: loop that simulates ongoing conversation. Each time the user enters input: User message is read and cleaned, and intent is interpreted using interpret_user_request()\n\nThe assistant routes the request to the appropriate handler: Weather, Cultural tips, Photo analysis, Event search, Itinerary planning, Translation, Memory recall, Handlers take care of fetching data, calling APIs, or prompting Gemini, then store the result back in history.\n\n---\n\n**🧠 Fallback Branch**\\\nIf none of the intent matches are triggered (e.g. the user says something casual or vague): The input is added to history, Gemini is called with full context to continue the conversation naturally. Optionally, if the user shares a preference (e.g. \"I love museums\"), it’s stored in memory[\"preferences\"] for future personalization. A try/except block ensures any Gemini API failures are handled gracefully without breaking the loop — offering a friendly error instead of a crash.","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def start_travel_chat():\n    history = []\n    memory = {\n        \"last_city\": None,\n        \"preferences\": []\n    }\n    onboarding_block = types.ModelContent(parts=[types.Part.from_text(text=onboarding_message)])\n    history.append(onboarding_block)\n    show_response(onboarding_block)\n    \n    # Main loop\n    while True:\n        user_input = input(\"👤 You:\").strip()\n        \n        # Menu options\n        # Quit\n        if user_input.strip().lower() in ['!q', 'quit', '!quit']:\n            print(\"Thanks for using TravelAIAgent.
