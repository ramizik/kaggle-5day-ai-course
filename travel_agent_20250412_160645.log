Here is the current weather data for Baku, Azerbaijan:
Description: broken clouds
Temperature: 10°C (feels like 9°C)
Humidity: 81%
Wind Speed: 37 km/h

Please provide a helpful, conversational summary of this weather information for a traveler, 
including appropriate clothing suggestions and activity recommendations based on these conditions.
Keep your response concise and natural-sounding. Do not use JSON formatting in your response.
2025-04-12 16:06:53,140 - WEATHER: Got summary from LLM: Okay, here's the weather for Baku right now: It's 10 degrees Celsius, but feels like 9, with broken clouds and pretty high humidity at 81%. The wind is fairly strong at 37 km/h.

Given all that, you'll definitely want to wear layers! A sweater or light jacket underneath a windproof coat would be a good idea. A scarf might also be helpful with that wind.

Since it's cloudy but not raining, outdoor activities are still doable, but keep the wind in mind. Maybe explore the Old City, visit the Flame Towers, or wander along the boulevard. Just be prepared for a bit of a breezy walk! If the wind gets too much, there are plenty of museums and indoor attractions to enjoy too.
