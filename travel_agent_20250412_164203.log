Here is the current weather data for Baku, Azerbaijan:
Description: broken clouds
Temperature: 9°C (feels like 5°C)
Humidity: 87%
Wind Speed: 41 km/h
Cloud Cover: 75%

Please provide a helpful, conversational summary of this weather information for a traveler, 
including appropriate clothing suggestions and activity recommendations based on these conditions.
Keep your response concise and natural-sounding. Do not use JSON formatting in your response.
2025-04-12 16:42:16,222 - WEATHER: Got summary from LLM: Okay, here's the weather in Baku right now: It's 9 degrees Celsius, but feels more like 5°C with the wind chill. We've got broken clouds and high humidity at 87%, with a pretty strong wind blowing at 41 km/h.

So, I'd definitely recommend dressing warmly! Think layers – a sweater or fleece under a windproof and waterproof jacket would be ideal. A hat, scarf, and gloves are a must to protect yourself from that wind chill.

Given the wind and cloud cover, outdoor activities might not be the most pleasant. Perhaps consider visiting some of Baku's indoor attractions like the Heydar Aliyev Center, the Azerbaijan Carpet Museum, or exploring the Old City's shops and restaurants. If you do venture outside, stick to areas sheltered from the wind. Enjoy your time in Baku!
