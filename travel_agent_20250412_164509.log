Here is the current weather data for Baku, Azerbaijan:
Description: broken clouds
Temperature: 9°C (feels like 5°C)
Humidity: 87%
Wind Speed: 41 km/h
Cloud Cover: 75%

Please provide a helpful, conversational summary of this weather information for a traveler, 
including appropriate clothing suggestions and activity recommendations based on these conditions.
Keep your response concise and natural-sounding. Do not use JSON formatting in your response.
2025-04-12 16:45:17,058 - WEATHER: Got summary from LLM: Okay, here's the weather situation in Baku: It's 9 degrees Celsius right now, but with the wind, it feels more like 5 degrees. We've got broken clouds and it's quite humid at 87%. The wind is also pretty strong at 41 kilometers per hour.

So, I'd definitely recommend dressing warmly! Think layers: a sweater or fleece under a windproof and waterproof jacket would be a good idea. Don't forget a hat, gloves, and maybe a scarf to protect yourself from that wind chill.

Given the wind and broken clouds, maybe indoor activities would be best today. Museums, exploring the Old City's covered areas, or enjoying a traditional Azerbaijani meal in a cozy restaurant would be good options. If you do venture outside, be prepared for a brisk walk and potential gusts of wind!
