2025-04-12 16:31:01,951 - WEATHER: Got summary from LLM: Okay, here's the weather situation in Baku right now: It's 10 degrees Celsius, but feels like 9 with the wind chill. We've got broken clouds and it's quite windy, about 37 km/h, with 75% cloud cover, so it's not a completely sunny day.

I'd recommend dressing warmly! Definitely bring a jacket or coat, and maybe a scarf to protect you from the wind. Layers are always a good idea.

As for activities, maybe consider indoor attractions like the Heydar Aliyev Center or the Azerbaijan Carpet Museum since it's a bit breezy. If you're brave enough for outdoor activities, just be prepared for the wind! A walk along the Baku Boulevard might be nice, but be sure to bundle up. Enjoy your time in Baku!
