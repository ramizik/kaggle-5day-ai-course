2025-04-12 16:35:15,320 - WEATHER: Got summary from LLM: Okay, here's the weather for Baku: It's 10 degrees Celsius, but feels more like 9 with the wind. There are broken clouds covering about 75% of the sky. The humidity is fairly high at 81%, and the wind is quite strong at 37 km/h.

Basically, it's a chilly and breezy day! I'd recommend wearing layers to stay warm, including a windproof jacket or coat. A hat and scarf would also be a good idea.

As for activities, maybe stick to indoor attractions today. Perhaps explore the Heydar Aliyev Center or the Carpet Museum. If you do venture outside, be prepared for the wind! A walk along the Baku Boulevard might be nice if you're bundled up, but keep in mind the wind chill.
