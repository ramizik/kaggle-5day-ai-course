2025-04-12 16:21:46,730 - WEATHER: Got summary from LLM: Okay, here's the weather in Baku right now: It's 10 degrees Celsius, but feels like 9 due to the wind. We've got broken clouds and it's quite breezy with winds at 37 km/h. Humidity is fairly high at 81%, and cloud cover is at 75%.

I'd definitely recommend wearing layers! A warm jacket or coat is a must, and maybe a scarf to protect against the wind. You might also want to consider a hat.

As for activities, it's not ideal weather for outdoor adventures, but it's still fine for exploring the city. I'd suggest focusing on indoor activities, like visiting museums or enjoying a cozy meal in one of Baku's restaurants. If you do venture outside, be prepared for the wind and potential for light rain.
