Here is the current weather data for Baku, Azerbaijan:
Description: broken clouds
Temperature: 10°C (feels like 9°C)
Humidity: 81%
Wind Speed: 37 km/h
Cloud Cover: 75%

Please provide a helpful, conversational summary of this weather information for a traveler, 
including appropriate clothing suggestions and activity recommendations based on these conditions.
Keep your response concise and natural-sounding. Do not use JSON formatting in your response.
2025-04-12 16:22:22,217 - WEATHER: Got summary from LLM: Okay, here's the weather for Baku right now: It's 10 degrees Celsius, but feels like 9 with the wind chill. We've got broken clouds and a pretty stiff wind blowing at 37 km/h. Humidity is at 81%, so it'll feel a bit damp.

I'd recommend dressing warmly: definitely a jacket or coat, maybe a sweater underneath. Consider a scarf and gloves to protect from the wind. Because of the broken clouds, there is a chance of rain, so it might be wise to bring an umbrella or a waterproof jacket.

Given the wind, maybe skip any activities that put you up high, like the Flame Towers observation deck, as it will be even colder and windier up there. Instead, focus on indoor activities like exploring the Heydar Aliyev Center or the Carpet Museum. Walking around the Old City (Icheri Sheher) is still doable, but dress warmly!
